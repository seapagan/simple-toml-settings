If the file already exists, the   settings are loaded from it instead. This can be disabled if required.</li> <li>Allows to run WITHOUT a settings file, so you can use the settings class   without needing to save the settings. This way all the defaults are used, and   then the user can manually create the settings file if they want to change the   defaults.</li> <li>The settings filename is configurable or defaults to <code>config.toml</code>.</li> <li>Provides a hook to run code when the setting file is first created, so you can   perform any initialisation required.</li> <li>Provides a <code>get_instance</code> method to get a single instance of the settings   class, so you can use the same settings throughout your application. You can   still create an instance directly if desired.</li> <li>Full test suite with 100% coverage.</li> <li>Supports Python 3.9 and above.</li> <li>Maintained and updated regularly with new features
