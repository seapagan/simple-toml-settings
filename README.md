## Development Status

Note that there is still additional functionality planned to be added to this
package, but the methodology is to keep the package simple to use and
understand. Any additional functionality will be added in a way that is backward
compatible and optional.

The package is considered stable and is being used in production in several
non-trivial applications.

Please report any bugs you find on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/seapagan/simple-toml-settings/issues) and
feel free to make suggestions for improvements.

## Installation

You should install this package into a virtual environment.  You can use
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to do this:

```console
$ poetry add simple-toml-settings
```

If you don't want to use Poetry, you can use pip from inside your virtual
environment:

```console
$ pip install simple-toml-settings
```

## Usage

This is a library to save your settings in a TOML file.  It is designed to be
simple to use and to be able to save and load settings from a TOML file with a
minimal of configuration.

The below is a minimal example, for full documentation and information on
available options, see the [documentation
site](https://seapagan.github.io/simple-toml-settings/). There are several flags
you can set to change the location of the settings file, the name of the file,
and more.

Usage is simple:

### Setup

```python
from simple_toml_settings import TOMLSettings

class MySettings(TOMLSettings):
    """My settings class."""

    # Define the settings you want to save
    name: str = "My Name"
    age: int = 42
    favourite_colour: str = "blue"
    favourite_number: int = 42
    favourite_foods: list = ["pizza", "chocolate", "ice cream"]


settings = MySettings("test_app")
```

The above will automatically create a TOML file in the user's **home** directory
called `config.toml`, in the subdirectory `.test_app/`, and save the settings to
it. If the file already exists, the settings will be loaded from it.

The file contents for the above example would be:

```toml
[test_app]
age = 42
favourite_colour = "blue"
favourite_number = 42
name = "My Name"
schema_version = "none"
favourite_foods = ["pizza", "chocolate", "ice cream"]
```

### Using the settings

Once you have created your settings class, you can use it like any other class:

```python
settings = MySettings("test_app")
settings.favourite_colour = "red"
settings.save()
```
